  - "Ever heard of a Khalbaccha? \n"
  - "It\u2019s an Indian tradition in farming."
  - They take a dead calf, and put him up on a pole.
  - "Do you think the mother\u2019s know? "
  - When the farmer puts a dead kid right up next to them and they...
  - "...stare that stare at its emaciated body.\r"
  - ...
  - "Whether the cow is aware of the horror or not doesn\u2019t matter.\n"
  - Y'see, these farmers...
  - " they\u2019re not talking to the cows. "
  - "They\u2019re talking to the cow\u2019s body. "
  - "You see, some force in the cow recognises there\u2019s a kid nearby..."
  - " Living or dead, don\u2019t matter."
  - "The udders swell all the same, and the cow produces milk.\r"
  - ...
  - 'This liquid-lifeforce was made to nurture the Khalbaccha back to life. Mind
    you, this is intense for the cow.

'
  - " It drains the hepher\u2019s energy for a hopeless task."
  - ' And maybe the cow thinks that it was all worth it...'
  - ' ...''cause the milk gets drained from their udders.

'
  - "and they\u2019re unable to comprehend beyond the scope of that, so long as their
    calf is fed."
  - "But that\u2019s not what happens, is it?"
  - ...
  - Burned.
  - Frozen.
  - 'Force-fed so many artificial concepts that that original natural wish perishes. '
  - "And then it all gets poured down some undeserving ape\u2019s gullet."
  - "What it could\u2019ve been..."
  - Heck, what it was meant to be!...
  - "...is nothing more than a waning shadow. \n"
  - Small text on the bottom of a carton.
  - ...
  - How was I ever meant to stand a chance?
  - ...
  - Oh well...
  - "No point crying over spilled milk\r!"
